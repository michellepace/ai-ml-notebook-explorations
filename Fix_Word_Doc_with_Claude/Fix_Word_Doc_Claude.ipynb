        ">Elevate your Word document with AI-powered proofreading that goes beyond standard spell-check. This notebook uses Anthropic's [Claude Sonnet model](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) to scan your Word documents, catching subtle language and style errors that often slip past Microsoft Word. Whether you're writing in English, German, Italian, or French, it preserves your intended meaning while polishing your prose to perfection—even for very large documents.\n",

So instead of one big file, I might end up with, say, 12 chunks that, if joined back together, would be identical to the markdown file. I do this so I can send these smaller chunks to Claude for correction, one by one. This picture explains it very well:\n",

Claude has a limit on how much text he can send back in reply to any prompt (4,096 tokens of text is the Claude's max.). So, if I sent all the markdown text at once, a lot of the content would be left out in Claude's corrected reply.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small chunks are also quite handy. They make it easy to compare the \"original chunk\" with the \"processed chunk\" I get back from Claude. For instance, I can quickly spot if the semantic meaning of the corrected chunk has changed compared to the original chunk. It's much easier to notice oddities with little chunks than one enormous chunk. Plus, if something goes wrong, I'd rather have a small chunk fail than the entire document.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The output below the code** shows a summary of the chunks your Word document got split into. The number of chunks is determined by the target chunk size I set. More on that below if you are interested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why I chunked with characters (not tokens)\n",
        "\n",
        "I chose to split the text into chunks based on character count rather than tokens. For instance, “split the document into chunks each about 1,000 characters long.” When working with large language models, it is far more common to split text by tokens, not character count. If you're curious as to why I chose characters (instead of tokens), here's the explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "**First, let's talk about \"tokens.\"** They're just a way to measure text size, like kilograms measure a person's weight. But here's the twist: while a kilogram is the same everywhere, tokens aren't. Each large language model has its own way of counting text size using its own “tokeniser”. So \"87 Anthropic Claude tokens\" isn't the same amount of text as \"87 OpenAI GPT tokens\". Language models don’t measure the size of text by counting words or characters like we do.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that Claude is limited to replying with no more than 4,096 \"Anthropic tokens”, it would obviously make sense to split text by counting tokens. So why did I use characters instead?\n",

        "I got a bit lazy. My text is in Markdown format, and I didn't want to break apart Markdown elements accidentally when splitting the text into chunks. I found a library that splits Markdown text while respecting its structure. The problem is that this library only allows me to specify target chunk size in characters (not tokens). Still, I thought it a better workaround than writting more code. As in, I thought doing rough math estimates was easier.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Claude can return a maximum of 4,096 tokens per chunk\n",
        "1. My equation: (prompt size) + (chunk size) + (wiggle room for corrections) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. Anthropic’s tokeniser measured my prompt (without a chunk attached) at 405 tokens.\n",
        "1. I decided 500 tokens for correction wiggle room would be enough.\n",
        "1. So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. This means that my chunk size must be no more than 3,191 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "And now using the data above to approximate:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3,191 tokens x 5.89 characters = 18,795 characters\n",
        "\n",
        "But hold on, 18,795 characters in English is about 2,565 words which is 5 pages in Microsoft Word. I want smaller chunks to pinpoint subtle changes more easily. In my prompt I instruct Claude to “make corrections but retain original meaning.” Having smaller chunks to compare means I can detect changes in meaning with more sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I chose 4,000 characters as my target chunk size because** this is about 545 words (just less than one page in Word) and about (4,000/5.89) 679 Anthropic tokens. Remember my wiggle of 500 tokens? This is about 400 words which is more than enough as I’m only sending Claude 545 words for correction anyhow. My numbers are rough approximations using the sample data above. But with a target chunk size of 4,000 characters (or 679 tokens) there are 2,512 tokens of room left anyhow:\n",

        "- So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size: 679 tokens) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "The only downside I see in using small chunks is a little more cost. Costs for API usage are calculated based on the number of tokens used, not per prompt. Because I’m sending more prompts than I need to, it just means I’m sending 405 tokens (i.e., the prompt measured without the chunk) more times than I have to as I'll be sending more chunks. That’s okay.\n",

        "I tested my prompt, and Claude was quite dependable in retaining original semantic meaning when doing corrections. However, I still wanted an automated way to check that this holds true for every Word document corrected. So, I set up three different ways to evaluate the corrected text against your original text. These provide confidence that Claude has enhanced your writing without changing its core message, structure, or content.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Document structure:** Are the headings and paragraphs still in the right place?\n",
        "1. **Document content - Word count:** Has the overall length changed dramatically?\n",

        "\n",
        "**\"Michelle, so much testing is overkill,\"** I hear you saying. I quite disagree, and here's why: Imagine I decide to switch to the free Meta Llama 3.1 model instead of Claude Sonnet. How would I know if it's performing as well as Claude did? What if I have 20 large Word documents to correct? It wouldn't be practical to manually check each one. What if my document is in Italian, should I assume Claude will perform as well, or should I have an automated way of testing it? Lastly, just because I've thoroughly tested one document, that doesn't imply the same level of dependability for another as content varies vastly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Manually testing for all these scenarios would be incredibly time-consuming. That's why these automated tests are so important to me. With very little effort, I can now have confidence in the quality of corrections across a wide range of documents and potential future changes."

You can express the same idea in multiple ways, and this check ensures that the corrected text conveys the same meaning as the original. While not as sophisticated as models like Claude Sonnet or GPT-4, it effectively verifies that Claude retained the \"original meaning\" during corrections, as instructed in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using sentence-transformers, you need to specify a language model for text comparison. I consulted Claude for options and selected the second-largest LLM on the list, \"paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2.\" This model offers high accuracy across multiple languages, including English and German. Claude suggested the second option in the list below, which is half the size. I declined.\n",

        "\n",
        "The smaller the angle is between these vectors are in dimensional space, the higher the similarity score (that is, the close their \"meaning\"). A score of 100% within a \"chunk pair\" means identical meaning, while 0% indicates completely different content. I generally look for scores above 80% to be confident Claude has preserved the original meaning while making corrections. A 70% score might indicate that the general topic is the same, but some details or nuances have changed. It's not necessarily bad, but it signals that a closer look at that chunk may be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "<figure>\n",
        "  <figcaption>Figure: Semantic Similarity Visualised: Smaller angles = More similar meanings</figcaption>\n",

        "  </a>\n",
        "</figure>\n",
        "\n",
        "I also look for differences between all the \"chunk pairs.\" For example, if all score above 80% but one pair scores, say, 60%, that's a flag to take a quick look. It means the corrected chunk in that pair has changed much more compared to the original than in the other pairs. This isn't necessarily bad—perhaps Claude fixed a poorly written section quite substantially—but it's worth examining.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, these scores are guides, not absolute judgments. They help you focus on areas that might need attention, ensuring Claude has enhanced your text while staying true to the original message.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The below code** displays the similarity scores for each chunk pair, along with the beginning of each chunk to help you quickly locate it in your original Word document. **Don't worry about the warnings**; they just occur first time the semantic model loads and don't affect similarity scoring.\n"

        "Creating the perfect instructions (or \"prompt\") for Claude is a mix of creativity and precision. It took me a bit of trial and error to refine the prompt to get Claude to perform as I wanted him to. As I was tweaking my prompt, I kept manually retesting the same things. That is why I wrote these tests – to automate my manual tests so I could tweak faster with more confidence. They send example chunks to Claude to ensure that no matter the tweak, he is still doing the  very specific things I care about, like correcting inappropriate word choice or bolding a correction using markdown format.\n",

        "For more encompassing testing, of both Claude’s prompt and code together, see the section 'Evaluate the output file.' In these prompt tests, I isolate the testing to only the prompt. None of my other code is involved in any sort of way. That was important.\n",

        "**You'll see in the output below that there are failing tests**. Try as I might, I just couldn't get Claude to consistently detect British English from American English and make corrections in the detected variant. As someone who prefers the Queen's English, I spent a lot of time trying to craft the prompt so Claude would get this right every time. Finally, I gave up and removed all associated prompt guidelines, and then added new guidelines to force British English always. For little pieces of text (such as in the test below), Claude does just fine. But for chunks that are close to 4,000 characters long he looses his way. I spent hours trying to reinforce the prompt so that this would not happen. I've given up for now. Claude must be American although if you ask him he'll tell you he's neither American nor male. Mmm.\n"
