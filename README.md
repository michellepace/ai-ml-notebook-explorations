# AI and Machine Learning Notebook Explorations

This repository houses a collection of notebooks dedicated to exploring various aspects of Generative AI, classical Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Each notebook investigates different concepts, techniques, or applications, primarily using Python. The goal of this repository is to share notebooks I made along the way in the aspiration that it may be useful to others. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific area, allowing for easy experimentation and learning.

## Notebooks

### notebook-01: Fix Word Doc Claude
This notebook introduces an AI-powered proofreading tool that leverages Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model to enhance Word documents. It's designed to catch subtle language and style errors often missed by standard spell-checkers, supporting multiple languages including English, German, Italian, and French.

Key features:
1. Uses the Claude API for intelligent text processing
1. Handles large-scale text correction in multiple languages
1. Highlights corrections in colour for easy identification
1. Preserves original document semantic meaning and structure
1. Includes comprehensive testing and evaluation

The notebook also serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development, showcasing how complex tools can be created with basic coding skills and AI collaboration.
