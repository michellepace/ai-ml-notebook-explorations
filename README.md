# AI and Machine Learning Notebook Explorations

This repository houses a collection of notebooks dedicated to exploring various aspects of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Each notebook investigates different concepts, techniques, or applications, primarily using Python and a variety of tools including large language models.

## Notebooks

### Notebook01 - Fix Word Doc Claude
This notebook introduces an AI-powered proofreading tool that leverages Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model to enhance Word documents. It's designed to catch subtle language and style errors often missed by standard spell-checkers, supporting multiple languages including English, German, Italian, and French.

Key features:
- Processes large Word documents (up to 42,000 words)
- Highlights writting corrections in color for easy identification
- Preserves original document semantic meaning and structure
- Includes comprehensive testing and evaluation

The notebook also serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development, showcasing how complex tools can be created with basic coding skills and AI collaboration.
