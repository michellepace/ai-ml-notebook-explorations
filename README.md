## About This Project

The goal of this project is to document my journey in AI, machine learning, and data analysis through interactive notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific area, allowing for easy experimentation and learning.

All notebooks are designed to run in Google Colab, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility.

## How to Use

1. Click on the "Open in Colab" badge for the notebook you're interested in.
2. The notebook will open in Google Colab.
3. You can run the cells and experiment with the code directly in your browser.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal exploration project, I welcome suggestions and discussions. Feel free to open an issue if you have ideas or spot any errors.
